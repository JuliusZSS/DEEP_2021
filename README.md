# DEEP_2021
DEEP code, causal tree, interaction tree

To run experiments using synthetic_data:
1. in synthetic_data folder, run sz001 sz002 sz003 to generate data
2. in synthetic_data folder, run sz101 sz102 sz103 to get causal tree results
3. in DEEP_R folder, run main_synthetic_self_training.R and main_synthetic_cross_validation.R to get DEEP results
4. in synthetic_data folder, run sz201 sz202 sz203 sz204 to analyse DEEP results
5. in interaction_trees folder, run Experiments_synthetic_self_training.R and Experiments_synthetic_cross_validation.R to get interaction tree results
6. in synthetic_data folder, run sz300 sz301 to analyse interaction tree results

To run experiments using real-world data:
